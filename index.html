                I am huge fan of games. Some of the best stories ever told have been in games, whether it's the story the game tells or moments you share with friends. Creating these stories and experences is what I want to do as a game developer. I spend most my free time coming up with video game concepts and prototyping them for people to try out. I have a few games I've been working on and every game has been a great learning experence. I also thoroughly enjoy tabletop games and running them. I have been running various RPGs, building narratives and creating worlds for 4 years now including D&D, Savage Worlds and Exalted. Players will agree that the highlights of my games is the pacing and the interesting character voices I create to give the NPCs personalities. My overall goal when running a tabletop game is to make sure that everyone is enjoying themselves and are engaged. Last year, I started a board game collection that I play often with friends and family. A few of my favorite games to play are Betrayal at house on the hill (so much replayablity), Fortune and Glory (india jones the board game...I do voices) and Ticket to ride (due to how invested new players get when someone blocks them). Other things I enjoy are the outdoors (walks/hikes), traveling to different countries and cats.

                Future Goal: learn japanese, go back to Japan (once first goal is accomplished), finish the D&D adventure "Rise of Tiamat" (I have yet to roleplay a dragon), get married to my fiancée, buy a house where I put up a really ugly ceiling fan (one of those weird from Home Hardware) and get this job interview (yes I broke the 4th wall)

The most innovative feature on this sticker book application was the ability for the users to take a picture of themselves and have the picture placed on a bobble head character. I developed this and it turned out really well. If you stuck a sticker to the bobblehead of yourself, the sticker would bobble along with you as you shake the screen.</p>

Magic Camera games create an immersive experience by combining those device capabilities with the phone's camera. My job was writing the library for both Android and iOS in order to use this functionality. I also wrote a good chunk of the original Magic Camera gameplay code.

                I am huge fan of games. Some of the best stories ever told have been in games, whether it's the story the game tells or moments you share with friends. Creating these stories and experences is what I want to do as a game developer. I spend most my free time coming up with video game concept and prototyping them for people to try out. I have a few games I've been working on and every game has been a great learning experence. I also thoroughly enjoy table top games and running them. I've been running on and off again for 4 years now; d&d, savage world and exalted. Players will agree that the highlights of my games is the pacing and the intrested character voices I create to give the NPC personalities. My overall goal when running a table top game is to make sure that everyone is enjoying themself and are engaged. Last year I started a board game collection that I play often with friend and family. Few of my favorite game to play are betrayal at house on the hill (so much replayablity), fortune and glory (india jones the board game...I do voices) and ticket to ride (due to how invested new players get when someone blocks them). Other things I enjoy are the outdoors (walks/hikes), traveling to different countries and cats.

                Future Goal: learn japanese, go back to japan (once first goal is accomplished), finish the D&D adventure "rise of tiamat" (I have yet to roleplay a dragon), get married to fiance, buy a house where I put up a really ugly ceiling fan (one of those weird from homehardware) and get this job interview (yes I broke the 4th wall)
